# Texas Child Population Analysis
### Purpose
<p>This project aims to predict/forecast and to visualize the change in the population of children in Texas and to examine its relationship to Department of Family Protective Services cases involving children under 18 yo.</p>

<p>By forcasting growth of the population of children and comparing it with the changes in Department of Family Protective Services cases involving children under 18 yo, government entities and programs can adapt and allocate resources more efficiently.</p>

### Data

### Further Research
<p>More research is needed to adequately analyze the relationship between the population of children in Texas and Department of Family Protective Services cases involving children under 18 yo. The largest need for resources is in large metropolitan areas and border towns that have seen an influx of unaccompanied minors.</p>

<p>With data on government budgets and resources, longitudinal data on unaccompanied minors in the system in Texas, we can better analyze the needs of this population.</p>
